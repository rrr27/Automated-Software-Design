        <h1 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Updating Correct files after Changing Error Messages</h1><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">MDELite
tests are based on file regression tests. &nbsp;That is, an MDELite
program produces a file. &nbsp;During a regression test, a new file is
produced and it is compared with a "Correct" version of this file.
&nbsp;If exactly the same text appears in both files, the regression
test passes.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Now
this becomes problem if error messages are updated, even slightly.
&nbsp;Tracking down small textual changes in hundreds of files is
extraordinarilly time consuuming. &nbsp;So I built a tool that takes
converts statements made by outdated Error and ParsE error reports and
refresh these statements with the new format.<br><br>Example: An Error is an enum with a value and a "parameterized explanation", like so:<br><br>anError("in file FILE you should have named variable VAR1 to VAR2")<br><br>In
the string explanation, all words that are in all CAPITALS (and that
they are not just one character long) are treated as String parameters.
&nbsp;When this error is reported, arguments for these parameters must
be provided, as in:<br><br>Error.throw(Error.anError, filename, varname1, varname2);<br><br>The
anError String is converted into a Java format string&nbsp;"in file %s
you should have named variable %s to %s" and then arguments are
supplied for each string %s marker.<br><br>So here's how the tool
works: it read a Correct file and for each line, the tool sees if it
can parse the line as an existing parameterized explanation. &nbsp;If
so, it then rewrite the line using the new &nbsp;parameterized
explanation string. &nbsp;The tool does this for every file in a
Correct directory for all Correct directories under test/.<br><br></span><h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">How to invoke the Update Correct Files Tool</h2><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Before you do anything, make sure that all regression tests of MDELite7 work. &nbsp;Next do the following:</span><ol style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><li>In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CorrectResultsAfterChangingErrorMsgs/</span> directory, delete <span style="font-weight: bold;">Error.java</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">ParsE.java</span>.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Copy via refactoring the <span style="font-weight: bold; color: black;">MDELite/</span> directory files <span style="font-weight: bold;">Error.java</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">ParsE.java</span> to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">CorrectResultsAfterChangingErrorMsgs/</span> directory.<br></li><li>Copy the entire<span style="font-weight: bold;"> test/</span> directory of <span style="font-weight: bold;">MDELite7</span> and rename the copy<span style="font-weight: bold;"> testBackup/</span>. &nbsp;The <span style="font-weight: bold;">testBackup</span> directory should be the same directory as <span style="font-weight: bold;">test/</span>.</li></ol><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">At
this point, you are ready to proceed to edit MDELite/Error.java and
MDELite/ParsE.java to change the error messages to that which you want
to use.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Once you have made all your message changes, it is time to update the Correct directories. &nbsp;Here's how to do this:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><ol style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><li>Compile MDELite7 to make sure there are no type errors.</li><li>Run
UpdateCorrectFiles.java from the Netbeans IDE. &nbsp;It will post a
Java GUI dialog to remind you of &nbsp;the three things that you should
have done above. &nbsp;Then it will ask for a password -- which you can
extract from the code of UpdateCorrectFiles.java. &nbsp;If the password
you supply is correct, all Correct files will be updated accordingly.
This update should take but a few seconds at most.</li><li>Next, compile MDELite7 again, and run the regression tests. &nbsp;If
the update was correctly performed -- and it should.... --- you should
get no errors and that the correct files are now using the latest&nbsp;
Error explanations.</li></ol><h2 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></h2>
